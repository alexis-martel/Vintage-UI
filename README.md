# Vintage Splash Screens, *About* Windows, and More!

## About

This repository contains a small collection of select vintage software screenshots. The captured windows include (among others):

- Splash Screens;
- *About* Windows;
- *New Document* Windows; and
- Registration Screens

from System 6 & 7, Mac OS 8 & 9, Windows 1, 3 & 95, and SerenityOS. All these screens have one common function: welcome the user and provide information about its software. They are often the first thing you see upon starting up an application, so special attention is *usually* given regarding its appearance.
